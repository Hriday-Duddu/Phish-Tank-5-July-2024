MetaMask also supports this feature, but having a successful swap every time is also not possible. Sometimes the processed transaction gets stucked in between and that’s a quite confusing situation for investors as to what to do.</p><p>Thus, with the help of this precise read, we will try to learn how to deal with stuck swaps while accessing the wallet through MetaMask Chrome Extension.</p><p>So, are you all ready to check how and what to do?</p><p>Great. Let’s check the information listed down.</p><h2><strong>Know about the Smart Swap feature</strong></h2><p>This feature allows users to swap crypto tokens from the extensions. What’s irony here is that this facility is only available on MetaMask extensions and on Ethereum Manniet. Sometimes due to unexpected issues/errors, a swap gets stuck in between, and encountering this problem, investors often lost the plot.</p><p>Well, the safest way to deal with this situation is to cancel the stucked transaction. Here, we are going to have a brief discussion on how you can cancel the queued transaction on the MetaMask Chrome Extension.</p><h2><strong>What to do if a swap gets stuck in between?</strong></h2><p>If you have enabled the Smart Swap feature on MetaMask, then you can cancel the executed transaction at any time before it gets confirmed. You can access this feature from the “Settings” section. When you turn on this feature, you can check the status of the processed transaction until it gets confirmed. Meanwhile, you can take action to cancel the transaction by clicking on the related label. When you hit on the cancel label, the in-progress transaction gets canceled at the same time.</p><h2><strong>Is the cancellation fee charged by the MetaMask Chrome Extension?</strong></h2><p>This concept is quite dynamic. This means that depending upon the situation either the investors are charged with a cancellation fee, or they are provided with an option wherein they can cancel the in-progress transaction at zero cost.</p><p>The option to cancel a transaction for free is available for a short time and barely. The team says that they try their best to make cancellation free for the users but they further added that this is not guaranteed by them. In case free cancellation is not available then the investors can cancel that particular transaction by paying a small gas fee. Whether a user will be charged for cancellation or not is not definite. The status relating to it is reflected on the cancellation page of the wallet only.</p><h2><strong>Final Lines</strong></h2><p>Through the above read, you might have gotten a surface idea of what you can do in case the swap gets stuck. This read clearly depicts that the stuck payment can be canceled through the wallet extension and has covered the necessary action to be performed while managing the wallet through MetaMask Chrome Extension. Further, you cannot cancel a Smart Swap using its app.</p><h2>‍</h2><h2>‍</h2></div><script crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" src="local_resources/js/04ed83e6a346a2ffc0cfe290c3ed3832.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script src="local_resources/js/a84e254fb73e3932c6271426c6807605.js" type="text/javascript"></script></body></html>
