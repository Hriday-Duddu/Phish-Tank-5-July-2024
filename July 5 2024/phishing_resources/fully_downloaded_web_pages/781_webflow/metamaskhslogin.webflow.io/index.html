It means CEX has the capability to hold your assets but when a CEX holds your tokens, it has complete control over the private keys of your tokens. So, for security purposes, it is not recommended to hold your coins over any centralized exchange if you want to actively contribute in web3 or want to sleep peacefully without any worry about funds’ security. Well! What to do then? A self-custodial wallet can be a perfect choice to secure your assets with high encryption.
