MetaMask uses advanced security measures such as two-factor authentication (2FA) and biometric authentication (such as facial recognition or fingerprint) to ensure the safety of users' funds.</p><p>In conclusion,MetaMask provides a secure and user-friendly way for users to store and manage their digital assets. The login process involves three primary steps: installation, account creation, and login.
